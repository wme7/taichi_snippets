# Taichi Tips
by Manuel A. Diaz @ Poitiers 08.2022

This repository snippets I used to become familiar with Taichi language and their developments with *Material Point Methods*.


## Refs
The tips are based on the blog post: 
* Hu Y. *Taichi Cookbook 001*. [Taichi Lang Blog](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/blog/taichi-cookbook-001)

The computation of the MLS-MPM solvers are based on MPM principles of Professor Zhang Xiong and the MPM88 of Hu Yuanming: 
* Zhang X, Chen Z, Liu Y. *The material point method: a continuum-based particle method for extreme loading cases*. Academic Press, 2016
* Hu Y, Fang Y, Ge Z, et al. *A moving least squares material point method with displacement discontinuity and two-way rigid body coupling*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2018, 37(4): 1-14.
